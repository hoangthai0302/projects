## How is it different from the already existing Remote app by Apple?
Functionality wise both are similar. Although, the Apple app only works on Apple devices. Whereas, this is a web app, you can open it on any device with an internet browser. And it works without Internet too.  
Make a hotspot âž¡ open the displayed link in a browser âž¡ annnd you're good to go! ðŸš€
